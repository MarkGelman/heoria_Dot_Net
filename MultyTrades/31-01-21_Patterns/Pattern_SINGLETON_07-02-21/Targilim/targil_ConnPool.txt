reate class DbConnection
create class MyConnectionPool [Singleton]
  MyConnectionPool:
  1. Singleton stuff....
  2. private List<DbConnection> m_connections
  3. in the ctor create 10 connections [10x new DbConnection]
  4. function called GetConnection
     DbConnection GetConnection()
     checks if m_connections.Count > 0 if so ->
            remove last connection from the list (the list should be 1 shorted)
                  if not return null;
  5. function called RestoreConnection
     void RestoreConnection(DbConnection) --> add the connection to m_connections
use lock wisely! :)
*etgar: GetConnection if list is empty then wait and check every 100 mili if a connection was returned
